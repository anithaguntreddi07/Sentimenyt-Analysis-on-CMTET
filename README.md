# Sentimenyt-Analysis-on-CMTET
This study addresses sentiment analysis challenges in Code-Mixed Telugu-English Text (CMTET). We introduce a new annotated dataset and apply a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model with a novel unsupervised data normalization technique, achieving 80.22% accuracy. Our approach proves effective for handling the unstructured nature of Code-Mixed data, resulting in a 2.53% accuracy improvement in our best model.
